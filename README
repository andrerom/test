(stable)There is really nothing to see here!

So sod off!
(or something, it's your time.. If you want to waste it, that's your problem)

Anyway..

============
To sum it up
============

GIT needs a lot more commands then svn, and most of the gui tools are still flaky..

New repo:
---------
mkdir <name>
cd <name>
git init
touch README
git add README
git commit -m 'initial commit'
git remote add origin git@github.com:<user>/<name>.git
git push origin master


Existing repo:
--------------
git clone git@github.com:<user>/<name>.git
cd <name>

New file:
---------
touch null.txt
git add null.txt
git commit -m "added null, how nice.."
git push origin master


Change file:
------------
nano README
# Do some text changes and save
git commit -am "Added some text to a file, hooray.."
git push origin master


Misc:
-----
git checkout README   # Same effect as 'svn revert'
git diff              # diff before you execute 'gitt add'
git diff --cached     # diff to see what you are about to commit (alreaddy done 'git add')
git pull              # Kinda like 'svn up'
git branch            # List branches ( -r : remote, -a : all )
git branch <branch>   # Create new locally branch
git merge <branch>    # Merge a branch with the one you have currently checked out
git cherry-pick <rev> # Merge a specifc revision instead of a whole branch
